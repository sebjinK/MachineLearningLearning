# WELCOME TO MACHINE LEARNING LEARNING

### This is my opportunity to understanding machine learning and deep learning
Currently, I have been using an MNIST database of images and labels, but have been unable to use the full 60k
images in the database. I have been using a subset of 10k images as practice, and will implement the full images and labels when I use threads to divide and conquer.

### This is a hard topic to get right
So please excuse my lack of commenting and documentation, I will document once I've fully completed this project 
### Currently on Part 2 - K-Nearest-Neighbor, changes focused in /MACHINELEARNINGLEARNING/KNN/src
